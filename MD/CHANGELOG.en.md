  - Meteorite Compass item that locates meteorites from CobblemonMegaShowdown
  - Structure finder for "mega_showdown:megaroid" (Y -32 to -20)
  - Structure finder for "mega_showdown:mega_site" (Y -19 to 5)
  - Right-click activation to search for nearest meteorite
  - Shift + right-click to reset compass
  - Data components for compass state storage (INACTIVE, SEARCHING, FOUND, NOT_FOUND)

- **Advanced Search System**
  - WorldWorkerManager for async worker coordination
  - SearchWorkerManager for managing multiple searches
  - RandomSpreadSearchWorker with spiral search algorithm
  - Non-blocking search up to 10,000 block radius
  - Sampling up to 100,000 points
  - Time-sliced execution (50ms per server tick)

- **User Experience**
  - Real-time HUD display during search
  - Shows progress (samples, radius) while searching
  - Shows distance when meteorite found
  - Color-coded feedback (white=searching, green=found, red=not found)
  - Client initializer for HUD rendering

- **Crafting Recipe**
  - Compass craftable with vanilla materials:
    * 4x Iron Ingots
    * 2x Amethyst Shards
    * 2x Glowstone Dust
    * 1x Compass
  - Early-game friendly, no meteorite materials required

- **Networking**
  - SearchPacket (Client → Server) to initiate search
  - SyncPacket (Server → Client) for state sync
  - Fabric Networking API integration

- **Technical Architecture**
  - Platform: Fabric 1.21.1
  - Fabric Loader: 0.16.9+
  - Fabric API: 0.108.0+1.21.1
  - Yarn Mappings: 1.21.1+build.3
  - Java: 21

  - German (de_de)
  - Portuguese Brazil (pt_br)

- **Technical Features**
  - Multi-loader support (Fabric + NeoForge)
  - NBT data component for target storage
  - Structure search caching (5-minute expiration)
  - Client-server networking for coordinate sync
  - Performance optimization (<0.5ms server impact)

- **Commands**
  - `/meteoritecompass reset` - Clear visited meteorite tracking
  - `/meteoritecompass info` - Display compass status and target

### Technical Notes
- Uses Minecraft's StructureManager API for structure location
- Implements custom ItemPropertyFunction for compass needle animation
- Compatible with Minecraft 1.21.1
- Requires CobblemonMegaShowdown as dependency
- Built on Architectury API for multi-loader architecture

### Known Limitations
- Only finds meteorites in already-generated chunks
- Works only in Overworld dimension
- Search performance depends on world size and structure density
